# About Aidan-vel

Aidan-vel is a light-weight clone of Laravel created for learning purposes

## Finished Features

* Views (basic)
* Controllers
* Routes (Support for GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
* Route parameters
* Easy access to request input ($_GET, $_POST, through one method)
* Support for method spoofing (so PUT, PATCH, DELETE can be used in forms)
* Support for different types of responses (i.e. files)
* etc.

## Planned Features (TODO)

* Database interaction
    * Models
* Possibly a rendering engine (maybe [Blade](https://github.com/jenssegers/blade))
